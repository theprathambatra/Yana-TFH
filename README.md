# The Français Hub — V1

A premium, editorial website concept for **The Français Hub by Yana Budhiraja**.

## Stack

- Next.js 16 (App Router)
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Motion for React
- Static export for GitHub Pages

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages

1. Create a GitHub repository and upload/push this project.
2. Make sure the default branch is `main`.
3. In **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
4. Push a commit to `main`.
5. The included `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` workflow builds the static export and publishes the `out/` folder.

The workflow uses GitHub Pages' resolved `base_path`, so project URLs such as `https://username.github.io/repository/` work without manually rewriting links or image paths.

## V2 landing page
A second, conversion-first luxury landing page is available at `/v2/`.
It uses the same brand assets and dependencies as V1, so no additional package installation is required.
The registration form does not require a backend: it opens a pre-filled WhatsApp message to Yana using the visitor's selected programme and form details.
